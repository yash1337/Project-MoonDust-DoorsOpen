# Project-MoonDust-DoorsOpen
MHacks17 project

I made this minimum viable product for getting started with a project that I have thinking about for a long time. 

Currently, working with my university's, [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), innovation department ([MSU HUB](https://hub.msu.edu/)) to implement this in the university departments.  

I eventually plan on starting my own startup around it.
